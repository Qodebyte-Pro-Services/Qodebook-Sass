README.md
Your SaaS backend is already robust and modular, but to truly scale and compete at a high level, consider these additions:

1. Multi-Tenancy & Data Isolation
Ensure all queries are always filtered by business_id (and branch_id where relevant) to prevent data leaks between businesses.
Add middleware to enforce tenant isolation and context on every request.
2. Audit Logging & Activity Tracking
Add a global audit_logs table to track all critical actions (who did what, when, and from where).
Log logins, data changes, permission changes, and financial actions.
3. Advanced Permissions & RBAC
Expand the staff roles/permissions system to support fine-grained, route-level and field-level access control.
Add middleware to check permissions before controller logic.
4. Notification System
Add a notifications table and endpoints for in-app, email, and SMS notifications (e.g., low stock, order status, staff actions).
Integrate with providers like Twilio, SendGrid, or Firebase.
5. Webhooks & Integrations
Allow businesses to register webhooks for events (order placed, stock low, etc.).
Add endpoints for third-party integrations (accounting, POS, analytics).
6. Reporting & Analytics
Add endpoints for sales, inventory, and staff performance analytics.
Consider materialized views or summary tables for fast reporting.
7. API Rate Limiting & Throttling
Add middleware to limit API usage per business/user to prevent abuse.
8. Background Jobs & Scheduling
Use a job queue (e.g., Bull, Agenda) for heavy tasks: report generation, email sending, scheduled stock checks.
9. Data Import/Export
Endpoints for CSV/Excel import/export for products, customers, sales, etc.
10. Subscription & Billing Management
Integrate with Stripe or Paystack for SaaS billing, plan management, and metering.
11. Internationalization (i18n)
Add support for multiple languages and currencies per business.
12. API Versioning & Documentation
Version your API endpoints.
Expand Swagger docs with examples, error codes, and authentication flows.
13. Security Hardening
Add 2FA for staff/admins.
Enforce strong password policies.
Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities.
14. Real-Time Features
Use WebSockets or SSE for real-time updates (e.g., order status, inventory changes).
15. Mobile & POS Integra

1. SaaS Subscription
Migrations: Create subscriptions table as described.
Endpoints:
POST /subscription/subscribe – Subscribe to a plan
GET /subscription/status – View subscription status
POST /subscription/cancel – Cancel subscription
Controllers/Logic: Handle plan selection, payment (stub for now), status, and cancellation.
Security: Only authenticated users; RBAC for who can subscribe/cancel.
2. Notifications / Activity
Migrations: notifications table (user_id, type, message, read, created_at, etc.)
Endpoints:
GET /notifications – Get notifications
POST /notifications/mark-read – Mark as read
Controllers/Logic: Fetch, mark as read, trigger on key events (e.g., low stock, new order).
3. Barcode & QR Code
Dependencies: Use bwip-js for barcodes, qrcode for QR codes.
Endpoints:
GET /barcode/:variantId – Generate barcode
GET /qrcode/:variantId – Generate QR code
GET /barcode/:variantId/download – Download barcode (PNG/PDF)
GET /qrcode/:variantId/download – Download QR code
Controllers/Logic: Auto-generate for each variant, support download.
4. Bulk Import Products
Migrations: import_history table (user_id, file, status, summary, created_at, etc.)
Endpoints:
POST /products/import – Upload CSV/Excel
GET /products/import/template – Download template
GET /products/import/history – View past imports
Controllers/Logic: Parse file, create products/variants, log history, return errors/success.
5. Security & Login
OTP on every login and forgot password: Enforce OTP verification.
RBAC: Role-based access for all sensitive actions.
2FA for staff/admins: Add 2FA setup and verification endpoints.
Password policy: Enforce strong passwords on signup/reset.
6. Expenses, Budgets, and Income
Migrations:
expense_categories (unique name)
expenses (category_id, amount, staff_id, etc.)
budgets (category_id, amount, period, etc.)
Endpoints:
CRUD for expense categories, expenses, budgets
Staff salary as expense (category: "salary")
Controllers/Logic: Only permitted staff can create/update.
7. Finance Flow & Analytics
Endpoints:
/finance/overview – Graphs/bar charts for sales, expenses, budgets, income, discounts, taxes, etc.
Filter by day, week, month, year.
Controllers/Logic: Aggregate and return data for charts.
8. Real-Time Features
WebSockets/SSE: For order status, inventory changes, notifications.
9. Background Jobs
Queue: Use Bull/Agenda for heavy tasks (reporting, emails, scheduled checks).

Attribute Ordering: If attribute order matters for variant naming, ensure the frontend sends attributes in the desired order.
Variant Uniqueness: You already check for SKU uniqueness. Consider also checking for uniqueness of attribute combinations per product.
Default Variant: When no attributes, you might want to auto-create a default variant with the product.
Variant Details: Allow custom fields per variant (e.g., barcode, custom price, etc.) if your business logic requires it.
Soft Delete: Consider soft-deleting products/variants for audit/history instead of hard delete.


Stock Reservation: If you need to support orders/invoices, consider a reserved stock state.
Stock Adjustment: Add an endpoint for manual stock adjustment (e.g., for inventory audits).
Stock Movement Types: Expand movement types (e.g., transfer, damage, return) for richer reporting.
Movement Reason: Add a required reason/note for all stock changes for better traceability.
Stock History: Provide a full stock history endpoint for a variant or product.

Batch Operations: Support batch variant creation and stock updates for bulk operations.
Validation: Add more robust validation (e.g., numeric checks, min/max values) on all endpoints.
Error Messages: Make error messages more user-friendly and actionable.
Swagger Examples: Add more request/response examples in Swagger for frontend clarity.

Attribute Sets/Templates: Allow saving attribute sets for reuse across products.
Variant Import/Export: Support CSV import/export for variants and stock.
Stock Alerts: Add notification/email triggers for low/out-of-stock/expired items.
Audit Logs: Track all changes to products, variants, and stock for compliance.

. Customer Browsing (Public Product/Variant APIs)
Add public GET endpoints for products and variants (no auth required, or customer JWT optional).
/api/shop/products — list all products (with filters, pagination, search).
/api/shop/products/:id — get product details (with variants).
/api/shop/variants/:id — get variant details.
2. Cart Management (Session or Authenticated)
For guests: Store cart in frontend (localStorage) or use a session token.
For logged-in customers: Store cart in DB (e.g., carts and cart_items tables) linked to customer_id.
Endpoints:
POST /api/shop/cart/add — add item to cart.
POST /api/shop/cart/remove — remove item.
GET /api/shop/cart — get current cart.
3. Customer Authentication
Add customer signup/login endpoints (separate from business user/staff).
Use JWT for customer sessions.
Table: customers (already exists).
Endpoints:
POST /api/shop/signup
POST /api/shop/login
GET /api/shop/me (profile, requires JWT)
4. Checkout & Orders
POST /api/shop/checkout — create order from cart, require customer JWT.
Store shipping info, payment method, etc. in orders table (add columns as needed).
Update order_items as you do for POS.
5. Payment Integration
Integrate with a payment gateway (Stripe, Paystack, etc.).
On successful payment, mark order as completed or paid.
6. Shipping
Add shipping address fields to orders table.
Optionally, add a shipping_methods table and endpoints.
7. Maintain POS Flow
Keep your current POS endpoints for staff/admins (authenticated, can create orders directly).
E-commerce endpoints are separate, scoped for customers.
